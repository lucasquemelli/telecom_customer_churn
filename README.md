Description

---

In any service-providing industry, when a customer decides to stop using the service, either by canceling the subscription or not paying for the service, itâ€™s known as Customer Attrition. Churn refers to how many customers are not using the service for a certain period. According to research, customer attrition costs businesses more than 1.6 trillion dollars annually. The US daily newspaper subscription market has the most significant turnover rate of any industry at 60%. Around 20-25% and 20-38% of customers churn in the banking and telecommunications sectors. One of the most common churn prediction strategies used by organizations is the identification of at-risk clients. This strategy has decreased customer churn by 35% of B2B firms.

Customer churn is one of the essential metrics that every business must evaluate to grow. Acquiring a new customer costs more than retaining the existing ones. Companies can spend less on operating costs to reach new customers by increasing customer retention.

**Purpose:** To build a machine learning model to help predict customers likely to churn in the next N months and facilitate taking business actions to reduce the churn.

**Strategy:** we used the CRISP-DS (Cross-Industry Process - Data Science) as the main project management methodology.
